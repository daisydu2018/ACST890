for f in *oo.txt
Do
## To search for the .txt file whose filename contains ”oo” and for each selected file, process a “for” loop.
cp $f /Users/new
##this line is used to copy the selected file to the dictionary /Users/new.
mv -v /Users/new/$f /Users/new/$(echo $f | sed 's/^\(.\)\oo.txt/ACST890_s1_2018_\1\oo.txt/')
## this line is to rename the selected file, -v is to only print the modified files. mv could be used to move the file from a dictionary 
to another and it also could be used to change the filename. In this case, the file with the name f in the dictionary /Users/new is 
modified to (echo $f), which is to print $f and at the same time, the result is piped to a second instance of Sed which introduces 
“ACST890_s1_2018_” at the beginning. In the instance of Sed, s is to denote substitutes and the content between the first “/…/” is 
used to represents the old name within which \(.\) matches the first part, which can be referenced by \1 (in the later part) and it 
follows by the “00.txt”. The content between the second “/…/” is used to represents the new name which puts “ACST890_s1_2018_” at the
beginning and follows by the \1 referring to the first part in the old name and file type .txt
done
## the end
